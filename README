Bindings to libqfs
==================

The C library lives at https://github.com/quantcast/qfs
After building the C library make the includes and libraries visible to the system,
as follows:

  ln -s $QFS_DIR/build/release/include/kfs /usr/include/kfs
  cp $QFS_DIR/build/release/lib/*.so /usr/local/lib
  ldconfig
